# cdcChallenge using D3 and Bootstrap
This code was developed during a CDC challenge. It provides a user friendly interface to explore data from CDC Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Uses data from ephtracking.cdc.gov and census.gov. Inspired form CDC’s “Info by Location” website . The app uses open source software with either MIT or BSD License. Following frameworks/libraries were used:  - Bootstrap - Framework for Website Development - v4  - D3.js - JavaScript Library for Data Visualization - v4  - jQuery - JavaScript Library - v3.3  - jStat - JavaScript Statistical Library - v1.6  - flexDataList - JavaScript Plugin

The easiest way to use this code is to place it in a web server. 

Another option is, if you have python installed on your computer, please go to the terminal on Mac/Linux or Command Window on Windows and run the following command:

python -m http.server 8000

and then open Google Chorme and type localhost:8000 and the web-app will load.
